# Friction Log (LIVE — bonus up to 10%)

Required fields per entry: task attempted / steps taken / expected vs actual / severity /
workaround / actionable suggestion. Add one entry per obstacle; never fabricate.

## 2026-09-17 — Node 22 vs required 24+ (skeleton env check)
* Task: verify local toolchain against Alexa requirement (Node 24+ in WSL2 Ubuntu).
* Steps: ran `node --version` (got `v22.19.0`), `wsl --status` (Ubuntu v2 OK), `git --version` (2.48.1 OK).
* Expected vs actual: expected Node ≥24 ready; actual Node 22 — upgrade still required in Win + WSL.
* Severity: Medium (blocks `alexa-ai` phase, not skeleton files).
* Workaround: pinned `24` in `.nvmrc`, documented `nvm install 24 && nvm use 24` in README; skeleton uses no Node-24-only APIs.
* Suggestion: Amazon docs should fail fast with a version check in `alexa-ai` CLI with an upgrade hint.

## 2026-09-17 — Empty workspace, no repo (skeleton start)
* Task: confirm starting point at `O:\Coding\REACH`.
* Steps: listed directory (0 entries); verified no git repo, no code.
* Expected vs actual: expected possible leftover scaffold; actual clean greenfield — full skeleton needed.
* Severity: Low (informational).
* Workaround: scaffolded workspaces (`server`, `windows-agent`), MIT license, base configs from scratch.
* Suggestion: n/a (project-side, not platform friction).

## 2026-09-17 — Alexa+ Private Preview gating (anticipated)
* Task: plan `alexa-ai configure` + `deploy` path.
* Steps: reviewed QuickStart; `configure` needs Preview-granted developer account (not yet requested/confirmed).
* Expected vs actual: expected immediate CLI auth; actual blocked until access granted — simulator fallback per rules.
* Severity: High if access delayed (blocks Phase 4, not skeleton/Phases 1–3).
* Workaround: build Phases 1–3 locally (agent → core → MCP Inspector); keep simulation path as backup; stub well-known auth routes now.
* Suggestion: publish current Preview wait-time estimate + a checklist for “no-access” teams to stay unblocked.

## 2026-09-17 — Missing Express types broke strict typecheck
* Task: run `npm run typecheck --workspaces` on fresh skeleton (strict TS).
* Steps: `npm install --workspaces` OK (182 pkgs, EBADENGINE warn for Node 22 vs required 24); typecheck failed `TS7016` for `express` + implicit-`any` params in both workspaces.
* Expected vs actual: expected clean typecheck; actual missing `@types/express` (express ships no bundled types).
* Severity: Low (skeleton-only, 5-min fix).
* Workaround: `npm install --save-dev @types/express --workspace=server/windows-agent`; re-ran typecheck → pass; verified `GET /health` 200 on :3000/:3001.
* Suggestion: template TS+Express scaffolds should include `@types/express` by default alongside `express`.
